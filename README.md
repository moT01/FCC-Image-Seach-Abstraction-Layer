## FCC-Image-Search-Abstraction-Layer
##### Image API project for [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/image-search-abstraction-layer)
##### Check it out [here](https://web-search.glitch.me/)

<br/>
<br/>

##### Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10 and browse recent search queries like this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/. Then deploy it to Glitch.
##### Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.
- User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
- User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
- User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
